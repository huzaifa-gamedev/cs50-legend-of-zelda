## 📋 Project Overview  

This repository contains my implementation of the **Legend of Zelda** assignment from CS50's Introduction to Game Development.  

🕹️ Inspired by the NES classic, this project enhances the dungeon-crawling adventure with **hearts, pots, and throwable weapons**, expanding gameplay depth and survival mechanics.  

📺 You can also watch my gameplay demo on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/2jVrMHtXrbk?si=89M16LnBJWaZZ5Mi).

### What I Implemented  

- ✔️ **Heart Drops** — Enemies sometimes drop **hearts** on defeat. Picking one up restores **a full heart** without exceeding the health cap.  
- ✔️ **Pot Objects** — Randomly spawned **pots** in the dungeon that the player can:  
  - Pick up (changes animation to carrying state).  
  - Cannot swing a sword while carrying.  
- ✔️ **Pot Throwing Mechanic** — While carrying:  
  - Player can **throw the pot** in the direction they face.  
  - Pot travels up to **4 tiles** or until it collides with a wall or enemy.  
  - On hitting an enemy → deals **1 damage** and disappears.  
  - On hitting a wall → disappears.

## 🧠 Notes on Implementation  

- **Hearts:** Implemented as `GameObject` with `onConsume` callback. Added healing logic with cap at 6 health (3 hearts).  
- **Pot Pickup:** Added **PlayerCarryingPotState** that locks sword usage and updates animations.  
- **Pot Throwing:** Extended `GameObject` with **projectile behavior** using `dx`, `dy`, and max distance logic.  
- **Collision Handling:** Pots interact with **walls** and **enemies**, disappearing or damaging appropriately.  
- **Integration:** Modified `Dungeon`, `Player`, and `GameObject` classes to support new mechanics smoothly.
